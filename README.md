# Reinforcement Learning PoC
Doing all the things related to reinforcement learning 
solely to experiment and get used to the concepts.
No particular goal in mind.
Obviously, this is not a production-ready code.

## How to run
```bash
$ poetry install
$ poetry run python main.py
```

## TODO
- extract rendering logic into the `run()` function instead of the env.
